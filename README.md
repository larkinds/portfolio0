<h3>A Portfolio Website</h3>
<p>Completely designed and developed by Larkin. The visual style is inspired by a favorite restaurant and minimalist maximalism.</p>
<p>The website was built using a serverless frontend through Gatsby to provide structure and awesome feature plugins,  React for components and pages, GraphQL for access to image and JSON data, and custom CSS for everything visual. It was deployed using Netlify. I chose not to use Gatsby's createPage API in this first iteration of the website in order to focus on learning GraphQL and look forward to learning it in the future (checkout my Projects to see what else version 2 has in store).</p>
