<h3>A Portfolio Website</h3>
<p>Completely designed and developed by Larkin. The visual style is inspired by a favorite restaurant, beaches after sunset, and minimalist maximalism.</p>
<p>The website was built using a serverless frontend through Gatsby to provide structure and awesome feature plugins,  React for components and pages, GraphQL for access to image and JSON data, and custom CSS for everything visual. It was deployed using Netlify.</p>
