          A woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle. -Gloria
          Steinem I only know that people call me a feminist whenever I express
          sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat. -Rebecca West
          Feminism is the radical notion that women are human beings. -Cheris
          Kramarae There is no female mind. The brain is not an organ of sex. As
          well speak of a female liver. -Charlotte Perkins Gilman Men are from
          Earth, women are from Earth. Deal with it. -George Carlin

          No woman can call herself free who does not control her own body.
          -Margaret Sanger I cannot understand anti-abortion arguments that
          centre on the sanctity of life. As a species we’ve fairly
          comprehensively demonstrated that we don’t believe in the sanctity of
          life. The shrugging acceptance of war, famine, epidemic, pain and
          life-long poverty shows us that, whatever we tell ourselves, we’ve
          made only the most feeble of efforts to really treat human life as
          sacred. -Caitlin Moran
